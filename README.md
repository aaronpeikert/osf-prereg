# OSF Preregistrations

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

This repository simply scrapes the Open Science Frameworkâ€™s (OSF) API to
get all preregistrations posted there since 2018 (2018-01-01) till today
(2021-08-18). No magic involved, just asking the api and flattening the
JSON into a single string and extracting attached files.
