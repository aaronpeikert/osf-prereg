# OSF Preregistrations

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

This repository simply scrapes the Open Science Framework's (OSF) API to get all preregistrations posted there since 2018 (2018-01-01) till today (`r Sys.Date()`).
No magic involved, just asking the api and flattening the JSON into a single string and extracting attached files.
